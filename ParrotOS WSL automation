The dialog shown is part of the Remote Desktop Connection in Windows. It prompts the user for confirmation to connect to a remote computer when the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified. This warning is typically seen if the server's certificate cannot be validated.

To automate the process and bypass this confirmation, you can use the following steps:

### Use CMD or a Batch Script to Automatically Accept
1. Open a text editor like Notepad and create a batch script (.bat file) with the following content:
   ```cmd
   mstsc /v:<remote_computer_name_or_IP> /admin
   ```
   Replace `<remote_computer_name_or_IP>` with the actual IP address or hostname of the remote computer. The `/admin` flag is optional and is used to connect as an administrator.

2. Modify Registry Settings to Skip the Warning
   To avoid this prompt, you can also configure the Remote Desktop client to trust the remote computer by tweaking the following registry key:

   Open CMD as an administrator and execute:
   ```cmd
   reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client" /v AuthenticationLevelOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
   ```

   - `AuthenticationLevelOverride` values:
     - `0`: Always connect, even if authentication fails (bypasses the prompt).
     - `1`: Warn before connecting if authentication fails.
     - `2`: Do not connect if authentication fails.

3. Suppress Warnings Using Group Policy
   If you're in a managed environment, you can adjust settings through Group Policy:
   - Open **gpedit.msc**.
   - Navigate to `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Security`.
   - Enable the policy **"Require use of specific security layer for remote (RDP) connections"** and set it to **RDP**.
   - Disable the policy **"Always prompt for password upon connection"**.

These methods remove the confirmation dialog when connecting to remote computers. Always exercise caution and ensure that you're connecting to trusted systems.

The **Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)** is not included in Windows Home editions by default, but it is possible to install it manually. Below are step-by-step instructions to enable and install **gpedit.msc** on Windows Home.

---

### **Method 1: Install `gpedit.msc` Using DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management)**

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**
   - Press `Win + S`, type **cmd**, and right-click on **Command Prompt** to select **Run as Administrator**.

2. **Run the Command to Install Group Policy Editor**
   Copy and paste the following command:
   ```cmd
   dism /online /add-capability /CapabilityName:Rsat.GroupPolicy.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
   ```
   This command installs the necessary packages for `gpedit.msc` on your system.

3. **Wait for Installation to Complete**
   The process may take several minutes. Once it finishes, you should be able to access the Group Policy Editor by typing `gpedit.msc` in the Run dialog (`Win + R`).

### **Method 2: Install Using a Third-Party Installer**

If the above method doesn't work or you prefer an alternative, you can manually add `gpedit.msc` using a lightweight installer.

1. **Download the Installer**
   - Download a third-party **Group Policy Editor Installer**. A popular and widely used option is the installer from [Windows Fixes](https://windowsforum.com).

2. **Install the Program**
   - Double-click the installer you downloaded.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to install `gpedit.msc`.

3. **Check Installation**
   - After installation, press `Win + R`, type **gpedit.msc**, and hit Enter.
   - If it opens successfully, the installation is complete.

   > **Note:** Some settings may still not work in the Windows Home edition since certain features are locked at the system level.

### **Method 3: Manually Enable GPEdit by Copying Files**
If you want a manual approach:

1. **Locate the Group Policy Files**
   - Find the Group Policy files (`gpedit.msc`, `gpedit.dll`, etc.) on a Windows Pro or Enterprise system.
   - These files are located in:
     ```
     C:\Windows\System32
     ```
     Supporting `.admx` and `.adml` files are located in:
     ```
     C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions
     ```

2. **Copy the Files to Your Windows Home System**
   - Copy the necessary files and paste them into the corresponding directories on your Windows Home system:
     - Paste `gpedit.msc` into `C:\Windows\System32`.
     - Paste `.admx` files into `C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions`.
     - Paste `.adml` files into `C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\<language folder>` (e.g., `en-US`).

3. **Enable Group Policy Services**
   - Ensure that the Group Policy Client service is running:
     - Press `Win + R`, type **services.msc**, and press Enter.
     - Locate **Group Policy Client**.
     - Set it to **Automatic** and start the service if it is not already running.

### **Testing `gpedit.msc`**
Once installed, you can test the installation:
1. Press `Win + R`, type **gpedit.msc**, and hit Enter.
2. The Group Policy Editor should open.

### **Important Notes**
- Some Group Policy settings may not apply on Windows Home because certain features are unavailable.
- Always back up your system before making changes to system files or using third-party installers.
- If you encounter errors, you may need to upgrade to Windows Pro to access full Group Policy functionality.
